# Jumpstart Lab Curriculum

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/JumpstartLab/curriculum.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/JumpstartLab/curriculum)

## Installation

### Ruby

Using RVM or rbenv, visit the project directory and the tool will guide you through installation. On ubuntu, system ruby-1.9.3-p290 works fine.

### Gems

```bash
bundle
```

## Authoring and Editing Content

### View

```
bundle exec rake preview
```

Generates the content and then lauches a Sinatra web application. 

In your browser visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) or execute `open http://localhost:4000` to lauch the browser.

> Note: This project contains a lot of content so the initial generation will delay the initial startup of the webservice for a few seconds. Saved changes to the content will cause Jekyll to re-generate all of the content causing a delay before it is displayed in the browser. Ensure any caching is disabled.


### Create

```
bundle exec rake new_page["path/to/new/page.markdown"]
```

This will generate a page file at the specified location. All content that is created should be placed within the source path.

> Note: Content pages should have the extension `.markdown` as the feedback link mechanism depends on that for creating the correct links to Github.

### Custom Page Attributes

#### Sidebar - Table of Contents 

You can automatically enable a Table of Contents for long pieces of content. This sidebar will place all `h2` elements (generated from `##` markdown) as linkable references.

An example:

```
---
layout: page
title: Object Oriented Javascript
sidebar: true
---
```

### Custom Tags

#### {% terminal %} CODE {% endterminal %}

Generates the text inside of a OSX styled terminal window.

Lines that are commands are prefaced with a *$*. Lines without are treated as output.

{% terminal %}
$ ruby -v
ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-darwin11.4.0]
{% endterminal %}

#### {% irb %} CODE {% endirb %}

Generates the text inside of a OSX styled IRB window

Lines that are commands are prefaced with a *$*. Linesk without are treated as output.

{% irb %}
$ 1 + 1
2
{% endirb %}

#### {% page_url filename-of-content %}

The `page_url` tag allows you to link to content without regard to knowing the relative or absolute path to the content item from the current item that you are editing.

```
### Great Javascript Tutorials

{% page_url 1-javascript-in-the-page %}
{% page_url 2-javascript-basics.markdown %}
{% page_url 3-dom-basics.html %}
```

* The resulting link will use the title of the linked document
* The extension of the file is ignored


#### {% section path/to/content.markdown path/to/image-to-display.png Title of Section %}

This tag will generate a special section layout which will embed the specified markdown content file in the page with an image and a special title.
